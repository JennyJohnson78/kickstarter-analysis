# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing Analysis on Kickstarter information to discover trends for a client looking to fund her own project. Client Louise wants to start a Kickstarter campaign for her project, and needed more information to determine the duration the campaign should be for, how likely it would be for her campaign to succeed or fail, and what kinds of Kickstarter campaigns reached their goals. Using descriptive statistics, this Kickstarter data was analyzed by success rate, failure rate, campaigns in the United States vs campaigns in Great Britain, the duration of a campaign, and the success or failure of different genres. This will help the client to determine the success she would have with her own Kickstarter.
